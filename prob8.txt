1). User Story 2 is implemented in the file CircumferenceCalculation.java. It represents the functionality of circumference. In this, circumference can be easily calculated by a person by just pressing the button “CRF” (type CRF) and entering the radius of the circle (the radius has to be a positive number).
2). User Story 3 is implemented in the file Precision.java. In this, the user will press the button “pi”(type pi). According to User Story 1, the calculator can display the value of pi up to 10 decimal places. Therefore, the user can choose the precision of pi up to 10 decimal places and this can be done by pressing “P” (type P). The user will then enter the precision that he/she wants to choose. (Enter a number). The value of pi up to the chosen precision will be displayed. The user can then perform the computation using this precision of pi. In this case, area of circle is calculated. The user will press the button for “Area” (type Area) and then enter the radius of the circle (the radius has to be a positive number). The area of the circle will be displayed.
3). User Story 6 is implemented in the file RecordKeeping.java. In this the user will turn on the calculator by pressing the “ON” button (type ON) and then enter the 2 numbers to perform the computation. (The program shows the computations on just 2 numbers for now.) After entering the numbers, an operator can be chosen from “+”,”-“/” and “*”(Enter one of these.).After the computation is performed, the user can press “R” to see the record, “C” to continue the computations or “OFF” to turn off the calculator (Type either one of them). If the user presses C, the user will continue to perform more computations, if OFF, then the calculator will be turned off and if R, the user can see all the computations that are performed after the calculator was turned on. The user is again given the option to turn off the calculator or to continue the computations.
